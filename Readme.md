# Introduction

The Lost and Found Website (PSP) is a web-based platform designed to help users report, search, and claim lost and found items securely. Losing valuable items is stressful, and returning found items to their rightful owners can be challenging. Our platform aims to bridge this gap by providing a structured and user-friendly solution.
# How It Works

Lost Item Reporting: Users can list lost items by providing details such as images, descriptions, and contact information.

Found Item Reporting: Users who find items can report them along with necessary details and a government-issued ID for verification.

Claim Requests: People who believe an item belongs to them can fill out a form, and if their details match the found item’s report, the owner can be contacted.

Admin Verification: Admins oversee reports, and help prevent fraudulent claims.

Payment System: Users must pay to list items and access contact details of found item reports.

# Key Features
